Some graph models and algorithms to be applied on Data Center topology

#### Contents

* part1 : generate Erdos-Renyi graph with 
  - G(n,m) model : a graph is chosen uniformly at random from the collection of all graphs which have n nodes and m edges;
  - G(n,p) model : a graph is constructed by connecting nodes randomly. Each edge is included in the graph with probability p independent from every other edge. 

* BFS.py : implement the breadth-first search for all nodes of the graph.

*part 4 : generate a fat tree topology graph and find all paths connecting a given source ToR and a given destination ToR. Find also all disjoint paths.y
